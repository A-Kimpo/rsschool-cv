# Aleksey Kondakov
## Junior Frontend Developer (JavaScript)

## About me
Hello, world!
My name is Aleksey Kondakov, and although my educational background is in the field of medicine, I have made a firm decision to transition my career to software development.
During my studies in the medical field, I developed problem-solving and work with a lot of information, skills that I believe will be valuable assets in the world of programming. I have actively pursued my passion for coding outside of my medical studies, dedicating my free time to learning various programming languages and technologies. 

Through self-study and online courses (Hexlet school), I have acquired a solid foundation in programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, as well as experience in developing projects on React + Redux.
My motivation to become a programmer is unwavering. I am driven by the endless possibilities of technology and the opportunity to create innovative solutions through coding. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and possess strong problem-solving abilities – all essential qualities for a successful programmer.

In addition to my technical skills, I have developed strong soft skills through my experiences in the medical field. Working in a highly demanding and fast-paced environment has honed my ability to communicate effectively, collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, and remain calm under pressure.

I'm looking for a job/internship as a Junior Frontend Developer.
Preferred work format: office/hybrid/remotely.

Completed training as a front-end developer at the Hexlet school. During the studying I completed 4 projects.
